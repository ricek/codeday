# The Game

### Design
Game theme based on domino and integration of League of Legends champion Teemo. The goal of the game is to click on a block that will lead to the domino effect and smash the Teemo to move on to next level. It's fun and very simple to play!

### Development
Made with [Construct2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2), a HTML5-based 2D game editor, developed by Scirra Ltd. The game can be run on most major desktop and mobile browsers. Developed by: [Liang Gao](https://github.com/ricek), [Xiang Li](https://github.com/GanixiL), [Muchian Lee](https://github.com/hla12345678910)
